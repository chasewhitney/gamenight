# Name of Project

GameNight is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and search for gaming events. Gaming events are created as either a board game, video game, or outdoor gaming event. Created events appear in a Google Maps UI which can be interacted with, allowing users to review event details, save the event to a My Events section and request approval from the host to attend the event. Once the event host approves a request to attend, the approved user has access to the event's address.

## Built With

MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express, Angular 1.6, Node, Angular Material, sweetalert2, nodemailer, passport
